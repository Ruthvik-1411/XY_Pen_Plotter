This repository contains all the information and resources you need to build your very own pen plotter. The pen plotter is a drawing machine capable of creating complex designs, patterns, and artworks on paper or flat surfaces. This project will allow you to explore the world of CNC drawing and unleash your creativity.

## What is a Pen Plotter?
A pen plotter is a type of CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine designed to draw or sketch images using a pen or similar writing instrument. It operates on two or more axes, allowing precise control over the movement of the pen across the drawing surface. The pen plotter can execute complex patterns and designs with exceptional accuracy, making it an excellent tool for both artistic and technical applications.
